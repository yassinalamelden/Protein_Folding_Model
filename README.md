## 📌 Usage

### **Option 1 – Run Locally**

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yassinalamelden/Protein_Folding_Model.git
cd Protein_Folding_Model
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3.Run Streamlit interface

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app/genatic_algorithm_method_streamlit.py
```

4.Select your options
- Input HP sequence or upload FASTA file
- Choose lattice type (2D square, 2D triangular, or 3D cubic)
- Select optimization method (GA or SA)
- Run simulation and view:
The app will:
  - Run the GA folding algorithm
  - Show minimum energy
  - Compare with optimal (if available)
  - Plot the folding structure
  - Runtime statistics

### **Option 2 – Run on the Cloud**

[**Launch Streamlit App**](https://proteinfoldingmodel.streamlit.app/)

(No setup required — just paste your HP sequence or upload a FASTA file to get folding results.)

## 🔎 Optimization Techniques

We have implemented and compared **three metaheuristic algorithms** for protein folding on the HP model:

- 🧬 **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**  
  - Population-based search with crossover, mutation, elitism  
  - Strong scalability for both 2D and 3D lattices  
  - Consistently achieves near-optimal energies  

- 🔥 **Simulated Annealing (SA)**  
  - Single-solution probabilistic search with temperature-based acceptance  
  - Useful for escaping local minima  
  - Performance depends heavily on cooling schedule  

- 🐦 **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**  
  - Swarm-based search guided by personal best (`pBest`) and global best (`gBest`)  
  - Encodes folding as particle positions/velocities in lattice space  
  - Achieves stable folds but slower convergence than GA on longer sequences  

---

### ✅ Summary
- **GA**: Best trade-off between runtime, accuracy, and scalability  
- **SA**: Flexible, avoids local minima but sensitive to parameters  
- **PSO**: Effective but slower on discrete HP lattice compared to GA
